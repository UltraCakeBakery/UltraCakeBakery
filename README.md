I'm a passionate Full Stack DevOps Software Engineer based in the Netherlands. For the longest time developing software has been my passion, to automate my goal, and to build robust software solutions my biggest dream. Now, with a keen eye for detail and a passion for problem-solving, I'm dedicated to creating high-quality software that delivers real value.

🔧 I enjoy tackling complex problems and crafting efficient solutions. My aim is to make the development process smoother, more efficient, and enjoyable for both developers and end-users.

👨‍💼 I am the founder of [managing.software](https://www.managing.software), a web agency that builds highly performant websites and apps for society-impacting organizations.
